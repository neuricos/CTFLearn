# Vigenere Cipher

The vignere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

Iâ€™m not sure what this means, but it was left lying around: `blorpy`

`gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}`

Use [this website](https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher) to decrypt. The ciphertext is `gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}` and the key is `blorpy`.

The flag is `flag{CiphersAreAwesome}`
