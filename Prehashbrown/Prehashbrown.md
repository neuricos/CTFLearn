# Prehashbrown

I created a database of all known types of hashbrowns! Try to see if you can find a way to authenticate as an admin and retrieve the flag. [Hashbrown Database](http://138.197.193.132:5000/login)

This challenge is broken. SQL injection doesn't work anymore.

By searching online, I found that someone who solved this challenge earlier when it is still working has gotten the flag `CTFlearn{h4shbr0wns_0n_th3_s3rv3r_@!#$<>[]}`

The solution of that user is screenshot and saved in this folder.
