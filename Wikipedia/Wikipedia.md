Not much to go off here, but itâ€™s all you need: Wikipedia and `128.125.52.138`.

Search the user with that IP address on Wikipedia, we will arrive at `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/128.125.52.138`.

Click "Flag" button and on the right hand side of [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag&diff=prev&oldid=676540540), we will see the flag: `cNi76bV2IVERlh97hP`.
